          "The company’s flagship AI assistant, originally launched as a note‑taking copilot, has evolved into a full‑fledged orchestrator of pre‑ and post‑meeting tasks. Instead of merely generating summaries, it now triggers deal desk approvals, updates CRM fields, and even sends personalized follow‑up emails on behalf of reps.",
          "The workflow engine uses a combination of large language models for context understanding and rule‑based automation to ensure compliance. Customers in the beta program report that deals move from proposal to signature 30% faster because approvals happen automatically when conditions are met.",
          "This shift signals a broader trend: vendors are embedding AI deeper into the systems of record rather than keeping them as standalone copilots. The business case is clear—integrated intelligence reduces context switching and shortens cycle times."
